# TUMORGROWTH
It's a mathematical model that describe the evolution of cancer cells in a cellular tissue organized as a LxL grid. This model simulate the evolution of a single tumor cell in a healthy cellular tissue using the interaction of a discrete models: cellular automata that describe evolution of tumor, normal and death cells and a continous model: reaction-diffusion equations that are system of PDEs used for describe diffusion of sostance like essential/non essential nutriments or acid due to Warburg effect.

-Python version it was used for my bachelor's thesis and simulate tumor vs normal cells with essential/non essential nutriment diffusion

-C++ version it's still under develop and describe the so called Warnurg effect i.e. acid-mediated diffusion.
